# AdventOfCode2015
http://adventofcode.com/2015

Just a simple hobby project for training my (.NET) development skills.

I try to focus on TDD, Clean Code and Design Patterns (e.g. Strategy in case of multiple solutions).

Feel free to use, correct, clean up, extend, comment, ... my code since it's not intended to be used in a commercial way.
